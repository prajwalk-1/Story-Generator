# Random Story Generator

This is a simple Python script defines four lists of story elements (characters, settings, actions, and objects) and a function generate_story that randomly picks one element from each list to create a sentence. You can run this script in any Python environment.

Feel free to modify the lists to include more or different elements to create more varied stories! If you want to add more complexity, you could include multiple actions, more detailed settings, or even nested structures of events.

## Usage

1. Download the `story_generator.py` file from this repository.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the `story_generator.py` file.
3. Run the script using Python:

    ```bash
    python story_generator.py
    ```

## Example Output

When you run the script, it will print a randomly generated story. Here is an example of what the output might look like: **One day, a brave knight in a dark forest, they escaped from a dangerous curse**
